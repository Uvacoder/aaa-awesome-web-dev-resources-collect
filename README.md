    - HackerRank is a technology hiring platform that is the standard for assessing developer skills for over 2,000+ companies around the world. By enabling tech recruiters and hiring managers to objectively evaluate talent at every stage of the recruiting process, HackerRank helps companies hire skilled developers and innovate faster.

    - Most beginners jump from memorizing syntax directly into making stuff (or trying) without fully understanding how syntax is used to solve problems. In other words, they haven't learned how to think like a programmer, yet they're trying to solve problems like a programmer. Edabit was created to bridge this gap, while also making the process fun and addictive.
